***About***

With SurveyMonkey, a sureyor can create a survery with a variety of questions. The questions are text-based and can be answered with either opened ended answers, a number within a range, or a selection based on some provided options. When a user fills out a suvery, the questions are presented in a form. The survey can be closed at anypoint by its creator, and results are generated.
