***About***

With SurveyMonkey, a surveyor can create a survey comprising a variety of questions. The questions are textual and can be answered with either open-ended text, a number in a range, or a selection from different options. When a user fills out a survey, the questions are presented in a form. The survey can be closed at any point by its creator, and then results are generated.
